In this project, I work on the Cardiovascular diseases dataset in Kaggle. 
I first do the data cleaning, data transformation and visualization for the dataset.
Then I apply logistic regression, random forest, KNN and ensemble model to make prediction, and calculate accuracy and recall. I also use resmaple techniques such as SMOTE to overcome class imblanace problem.
